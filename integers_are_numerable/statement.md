# Integers are numerable 

Every natural numer is an intger, but the opposite is not true.
With this, you might be lead to belive that there are more integer numbers than natural ones.
However, Kantor thought as that in a certain sense this is not that true, after all.
According to Kantor the infinite set of the naturals and the infinite set of the integers have are equicardinal in that there is a 1,1-correspondence between the two.
In this way, you can numer all the integers as:
the first integer (the one in 1,1-correspondence with $0$), the second one (the one in 1,1-correspondence with $1$), and so forth, ...

Write a function that given an integers, returns iit position in the above listing.

Write a function that given a position, returns the integer in that position.

Of course, TuringArena will make sure that the two functions are one the invers of the other.
We call them the ranking and the unranking functions.
